Boot Camp Prework Study Guide
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

- My motivation behind completing this project was to learn an introductory base understanding of the foundations of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
- I built this project to test my current abilities in being able to code and develop a web page on my own knowledge.
- It solves turning an ordinary web page into a site that has a nice design behind it aswell as a good structure to its organization and functionality.
- I was givin an introduction to the basics of coding and what it entails to built a web page with the tools that were taught to me.

## Installation

At the foundation of the website exists its HTML, providing the text and images for the site to display aswell as its header and list items. CSS follows next providing style, coloration and margin properties and padding which indicate how much space we as developers want to create beween elements, and adding space around the content inside the element. JavaScript introduced a way for the site to compute and analyze the information that is presented on the page, giving it the ability to function and respond acordingly. GitHub was is a very helpful tool to be able to branch out the various code to overlay on one another and work in unison with the ability to create new branches from the main one. Together, these four coding languages work together to create a web page that is equally enjoyable to use as it is to look at.

        === checks to see if two values are equal, and will return either a true or a false
    Git
        Adds branching to already existing main branch
        Default branch is called <main> or <master>
